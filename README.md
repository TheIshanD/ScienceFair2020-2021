By: Ishan Dasgupta 

This is a project that anaylzed and parsed the driving distances from govenrment sources and collaborative projects to find the effects of granting pharmacies access to methadone maintanance treatment in travis county. This research could lead to legal and social changes for the community allowing those taking opioid drugs to obtain more accessable treatment. According to my research, such a legal change could have massive effects and imapacts on those who need it most.
